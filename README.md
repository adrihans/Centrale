# Centrale

This repo contains projects made at the Ecole Centrale de Lille in my last year as student in that school.
Most of the projects were made with another student : Tanguy Jeanneau. 

## Those projects were part of the evaluation for several subjects studied at Centrale: 
- Machine Learning
- Optimization
- Information Security
- Markov Chains
- Estimation
- Ensemble Learning
- Java

Most of those projects were made using Python, except the ones made for the Java Classes, which were made, obviously, using Java. 
For nearly every projects, you will find the instructions to follow to fulfill the tasks and the associated notebook, together with an html export.
